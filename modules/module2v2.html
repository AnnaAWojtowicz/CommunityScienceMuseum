            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
                into the great wonders of the tiny world.
            </p>
            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to
                the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
                heart transplant.</p>
            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
